# UoM_Bird
Tried to make a flappy bird game for a university project.
Game is in java and of course if it seems wrong to you then i can assure you it is. It works though so that's something.
Collision is crappy, i couldn't get the images for the pipes to work and i am currently working on fixing these two.
